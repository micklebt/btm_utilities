## Priority Recommendations

### Start with these documents FIRST:
1. **Project Charter** - Get clear on what you're building and why
2. **Business Requirements Document** - Define what the system must do
3. **User Personas** - Know who you're building for
4. **System Architecture Document** - Plan your technical approach
5. **Work Breakdown Structure** - Break down all the work

### Create these BEFORE coding begins:
6. **Wireframes/Mockups** - Visual representation of the UI
7. **Database Design Document** - Plan your data structure
8. **Test Plan** - Know how you'll verify it works
9. **Definition of Done** - Clear completion criteria
10. **Risk Management Plan** - Prepare for potential issues

### Develop these DURING development:
11. **API Design Document** - As you build your interfaces
12. **User Manual** - As features are completed
13. **Operations Manual** - As you finalize deployment

## Document Templates Location
Consider creating a standardized template for each document type and storing them in a dedicated "Project Templates" folder in your Google Drive for reuse across projects.

## Version Control for Documents
- Store all documents in version control alongside your code
- Use meaningful commit messages for document changes
- Tag major document versions
- Maintain a master document index with current version numbers
